        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is softened, and your eggs are room temperature.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
                <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water; add to batter along with salt and mix until combined.</li>
                <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts until a soft dough forms.</li>
                <li>Drop rounded spoonfuls of cookie dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
